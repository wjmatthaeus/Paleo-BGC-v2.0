# stem-BGC
Xylem limited Paleo-BGC

Extension of Paleo-BGC (github.com/josephdwhite/paleo-bgc) to represent stem limitation of ecosystem water transport and function, with automatic sapwood phenology at a global scale.

This model version was used for the manuscript by Matthaeus et al. in review entitled "Vegetation turnovers reduced water availability during the last icehouse." and is the basis for the June 2025 Summer training computational paleoecology course "Cells to Ecosystems."
